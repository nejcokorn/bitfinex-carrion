# About
This project was created to trade small pairs on BitFinex.
Few years back I was able to make around 10k in a year but then too many bots were put in the market which killed the big spread on the small pairs

This project was created to trade on pairs where spread was 2% or more on BitFinex.
A few years back, I was able to make around 10k in a year, but then too many bots were introduced to the market, which diminished the significant spread.

I am making this code public in case someone finds it interesting or if someone wants to use the base code.
